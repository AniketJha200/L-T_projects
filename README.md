# Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alert System

## ðŸ§  Aim

The objective of this project is to design a **Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alert System** using an **Eye Blink Sensor**, **Arduino**, and a **buzzer alert mechanism**. The system monitors the driverâ€™s eye activity in real-time and triggers an audible alarm when drowsiness or frequent blinking is detected. The project includes simulation using **Tinkercad**, with the potential for real-world implementation involving RF modules for wireless alert transmission between a transmitter and receiver unit.

## âœ… Results

- A working simulation of the circuit was successfully built using **Tinkercad**.
- The Eye Blink Sensor was integrated with the Arduino to detect eye closure and blink patterns.
- A buzzer was triggered using an appropriate signal condition, alerting the user upon drowsiness detection.
- Although RF communication modules and encoder/decoder ICs were specified in the full design, they were not simulated due to platform limitations.
- Power supplies and regulators (such as the 7805 and external batteries) were conceptually included but simulated using direct 5V from the Arduino in Tinkercad.
- The project achieved its primary goal of detecting driver drowsiness and triggering alerts in a simplified and educational simulation environment.

> **Note:** This project was implemented using Tinkercad simulation tools. As such, PCB design and Gerber files were not applicable in this version.
